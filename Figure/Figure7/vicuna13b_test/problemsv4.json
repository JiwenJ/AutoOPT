This method iteratively solves a sequence of quadratic programming subproblems that approximate the original problem. The subproblems are solved using a combination of gradient-based and Newton-based methods.\n\nIn summary, the optimal solution to this problem can be found by solving the NLP problem using specialized solvers or applying the KKT conditions."

We know that the farmer can grow at most 300 tons of crop C and 250 tons of crop D per year:\n\n$$\nc \\leq 300\n$$\n\n$$\nd \\leq 250\n$$\n\nAdditionally, both $c$ and $d$ need to be non-negative:\n\n$$\nc \\geq 0\n$$\n\n$$\nd \\geq 0\n$$\n\nPutting all these elements together, we have the following optimization problem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{maximize} \\quad & I(c, d) = -c^2 + 150c - d^2 + 120d \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & c \\leq 300 \\\\\n& d \\leq 250 \\\\\n& c \\geq 0 \\\\\n& d \\geq 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem since the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are all linear with respect to the decision variables.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a QP solver or analyze its feasible region and check the value of the objective function at its vertices. Due to the structure of the problem and the fact that the objective function is quadratic, the optimal solution will occur at one of the vertices of the feasible region.\n\nThe vertices of the feasible region are:\n- $(c=0, d=0)$, which corresponds to no crop sales.\n- $(c=0, d=250)$, which corresponds to only selling crop D.\n- $(c=300, d=0)$, which corresponds to only selling crop C.\n- $(c=0, d=250)$, which corresponds to selling both crops but no crop C.\n- $(c=300, d=0)$, which corresponds to selling both crops but no crop D.\n- $(c=200, d=50)$, where both crops are sold.\n\nWe can now plug each vertex into the objective function and find the one that maximizes the farmer's income:\n\n- $(c=0, d=0)$: $I(0, 0) = 0$\n- $(c=0, d=250)$: $I(0, 250) = -6250$\n- $(c=300, d=0)$: $I(300, 0) = 45000$\n- $(c=0, d=250)$: $I(0, 250) = -6250$\n- $(c=300, d=0)$: $I(300, 0) = 45000$\n- $(c=200, d=50)$: $I(200, 50) = 20500$\n\nTherefore, the farmer should grow 200 tons of crop C and 50 tons of crop D to maximize his income."

        "Modeling": "This is essentially a version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with an additional constraint of minimizing danger. The goal is to find the least dangerous path that visits each animal exactly once and returns to the camp. Here, the danger level is defined as the distance multiplied by a constant factor of 0.1. \n\nLet's define the following:\n\n- $n$ is the number of animals, which is 10 in this problem.\n- $d_{ij}$ is the distance between animal $i$ and animal $j$.\n- $c_{ij}$ is the danger level between animal $i$ and animal $j$, which is equal to $d_{ij}$ multiplied by 0.1.\n- $x_{ij}$ is a binary decision variable, equal to 1 if the photographer travels from animal $i$ to animal $j$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe can now formulate the problem as follows:\n\n**Objective function**: The objective is to minimize the total danger level. This can be mathematically represented as:\n\n$$\\min \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{n} c_{ij} x_{ij}$$\n\n**Constraints**:\n\n1. Each animal must be visited exactly once. This implies that the photographer must leave each animal once, and enter each animal once:\n\n   $$\\sum_{i=1, i \\neq j}^{n} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall j \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$$\n   \n   $$\\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i}^{n} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$$\n\n2. We must also avoid sub-tours (where the photographer might visit a subset of animals and return to the camp without visiting all the animals). There are different ways to add constraints to prevent sub-tours, one of which is the following set of constraints, called Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) constraints:\n\n   Let $u_{i}$ be the order in which the photographer visits animal $i$. Then we have:\n\n   $$u_{i} - u_{j} + nx_{ij} \\leq n-1, \\forall 1 \\leq i \\neq j \\leq n$$\n   \n   $$u_{i} \\geq 2, \\forall 2 \\leq i \\leq n$$\n\n**Type of the problem**: This is a Mixed Integer Programming problem because it involves both binary decision variables ($x_{ij}$) and continuous variables ($u_{i}$).\n\nThe reason we model the problem this way is because we want to find the route with the minimum total danger level, which is the sum of the danger levels for each leg of the trip. This objective naturally leads to the minimization problem stated above. The constraints are based on the properties of the problem - each animal must be visited exactly once and sub-tours should be avoided. The use of binary decision variables is standard in route optimization problems like the TSP, as they provide a clear and easy way to represent whether a particular leg of the trip is included in the route or not. The MTZ constraints are a common method used to eliminate sub-tours in TSP problems.",

Let's assume that the photographer has a total budget of $B$ dollars, and the cost of taking a picture of an animal is $c_{i}$.

To solve this problem, we can use a branch-and-bound algorithm or a mixed-integer programming solver.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a greedy algorithm to find a feasible solution. We can sort the items in decreasing order of usefulness per unit weight (i.e., usefulness divided by weight) and pack them in that order until we reach the weight limit. In this case, the order would be I, H, G, F. This would result in a total usefulness of 1700 points (900 for I and 800 for H) and a total weight of 6 kg (4 kg for I and 2 kg for H)."

        "Modeling": "This is a classic problem known as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem in Operations Research. The VRP is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this case, we are dealing with a version of VRP with Euclidean distances, multiple vehicles, and capacity constraints.\n\nLet's start by defining our decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\nWe will define the binary decision variable $x_{ijk}$ that equals 1 if vehicle $k$ travels directly from customer $i$ to customer $j$, and 0 otherwise. Note that we consider the warehouse as a customer for modeling purposes. There are 5 vehicles and 21 locations (including the warehouse), so $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 20\\}$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 5\\}$.\n\n**Objective Function:**\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles. The distance between two locations $i$ and $j$ can be computed by the Euclidean distance, denoted as $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2}$. So, the objective function is:\n\n$$\\min \\sum_{i=0}^{20} \\sum_{j \\ne i}^{20} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} d_{ij} \\cdot x_{ijk}$$\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1. **Flow constraints:** Each customer is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle:\n\n    $$\\sum_{j \\ne i} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} x_{ijk} = 1, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 20\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{j \\ne i} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} x_{jik} = 1, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 20\\}$$\n\n2. **Vehicle constraints:** The vehicles start and end their route at the warehouse:\n\n    $$\\sum_{j=1}^{20} x_{0jk} = 1, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 5\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_{i0k} = 1, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 5\\}$$\n\n3. **Subtour elimination constraints:** To avoid any vehicle making a tour and returning to the warehouse without visiting all the required customers (i.e., forming a subtour), we need to add subtour elimination constraints. These constraints can be formulated in several ways, but one common approach is to introduce auxiliary variables $u_i$, which indicate the position of customer $i$ in the vehicle's route. These constraints can then be written as:\n\n    $$u_i - u_j + 1 \\le (20 - 1) \\cdot (1 - x_{ijk}), \\quad \\forall i \\ne j, i, j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 20\\}, k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 5\\}$$\n\nThis model is an example of an Integer Programming (IP) problem because our decision variables are binary. However, due to the subtour elimination constraints, this problem is not a linear problem but rather a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem.

        "One-shot": "This is a classic problem known as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a well-studied problem in Operations Research. The CVRP is a generalization of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with capacity constraints. In this case, we are dealing with a version of CVRP with Euclidean distances.\n\nLet's start by defining our decision variables, objective function, and constraints.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n\nWe will define the binary decision variable $x_{ijk}$ that equals 1 if vehicle $k$ travels directly from customer $i$ to customer $j$, and 0 otherwise. Note that we consider the depot as a customer for modeling purposes. There are 4 vehicles and 10 customers, so $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 9\\}$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nWe will also define the continuous decision variable $y_{ik}$ that represents the amount of goods delivered to customer $i$ by vehicle $k$. There are 10 customers and 4 vehicles, so $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}$ and $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n**Objective Function:**\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles. The distance between two locations $i$ and $j$ can be computed by the Euclidean distance, denoted as $d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2}$. So, the objective function is:\n\n$$\\min \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\sum_{j \\ne i}^{9} \\sum_{k=1}^{4} d_{ij} \\cdot x_{ijk}$$\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1. **Flow constraints:** Each customer is visited exactly once by exactly one vehicle, and the total demand of each vehicle does not exceed its capacity:\n\n    $$\\sum_{j \\ne i} x_{ijk} = 1, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{i \\ne j} x_{ijk} = 1, \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{9} y_{ik} \\le 50, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{9} y_{ik} \\ge d_i, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n    $$y_{ik} \\le d_i \\cdot x_{ijk}, \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\n2. **Vehicle constraints:** The vehicles start and end their route at the depot:\n\n    $$\\sum_{j=1}^{9} x_{0jk} = 1, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_{i0k} = 1, \\quad \\forall k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\n3. **Subtour elimination constraints:** To avoid any vehicle making a tour and returning to the depot without visiting all the required customers (i.e., forming a subtour), we need to add subtour elimination constraints. These constraints can be formulated in several ways, but one common approach is to introduce auxiliary variables $u_i$, which indicate the position of customer $i$ in the vehicle's route. These constraints can then be written as:\n\n    $$u_i - u_j + 1 \\le (9 - 1) \\cdot (1 - x_{ijk}), \\quad \\forall i \\ne j, i, j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 9\\}, k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\nThis model is an example of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem because our decision variables are binary and continuous. It's also important to note that CVRPs are NP-hard, so they can be computationally challenging to solve.",
        "Few-shot": "Let's establish a mathematical model for this problem.\n\nFirst, let's define our decision variables:\n- Let $x_{i,j}$ be the amount of goods delivered from vehicle $i$ to customer $j$.\n- Let $d_{i,j}$ be the distance traveled by vehicle $i$ to deliver goods to customer $j$.\n\nOur objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the vehicles, which can be represented by the following function:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{9} d_{i,j}\n$$\n\nNow, we need to define the constraints of the problem. We know that each vehicle has a capacity of 50 units, so the amount of goods delivered from each vehicle cannot exceed 50:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{9} x_{i,j} \\leq 50, \\quad i=1,2,3,4\n$$\n\nAdditionally, each customer must receive their demand:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i,j} = d_j, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n$$\n\nwhere $d_j$ is the demand of customer $j$.\n\nFurthermore, the amount of goods delivered cannot be negative:\n\n$$\nx_{i,j} \\geq 0, \\quad i=1,2,3,4, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n$$\n\nFinally, we need to define the distance traveled by each vehicle. This can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:\n\n$$\nd_{i,j} = \\sqrt{(x_{i,j} - x_{0,j})^2 + (x_{i,j+9} - x_{0,j+9})^2}, \\quad i=1,2,3,4, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n$$\n\nwhere $(x_{0,j}, x_{0,j+9})$ is the location of customer $j$.\n\nPutting all these elements together, we have the following optimization problem:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad & \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{9} d_{i,j} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\sum_{j=1}^{9} x_{i,j} \\leq 50, \\quad i=1,2,3,4 \\\\\n& \\sum_{i=1}^{4} x_{i,j} = d_j, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\\\\n& x_{i,j} \\geq 0, \\quad i=1,2,3,4, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \\\\\n& d_{i,j} = \\sqrt{(x_{i,j} - x_{0,j})^2 + (x_{i,j+9} - x_{0,j+9})^2}, \\quad i=1,2,3,4, \\quad j=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem since the decision variables are both continuous (the distances traveled) and discrete (the amounts of goods delivered). To solve this problem, we can use MIP solvers such as Gurobi or CPLEX.\n\nAlternatively, we can use heuristics or metaheuristics such as the Clarke and Wright savings algorithm or the genetic algorithm to find a good solution. These methods may not guarantee an optimal solution, but they can be faster and more practical for large-scale problems."
