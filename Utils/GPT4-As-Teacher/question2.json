The company needs to deliver flowers to 10 customers with the following orders: 15, 10, 25, 20, 25, 10, 15, 30, 5, and 20 flowers. The company's shop is located at (0,0) and the customers are located at (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,1), (2,-2), (-2,-2), (-2,2), (2,2), (3,-3), and (-3,-3) respectively. The distance between any two locations is calculated using the Chebyshev distance formula. How can the company plan the routes of its cars while delivering all the flowers and not exceeding the cars' capacities?\n",
